# toastr.js
Android Style Toast Notification Plugin for Web

Since toastr.js is written in vanilla javascript, it is light weight and it doesn't require any additional dependencies.

Although, the default style is the replica of Android toast, you can still customize it with available options like theme, position, animation etc...
